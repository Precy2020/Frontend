     <h1>Have you ever wondered what DOM, BOM, DOM manipulation and BOM manipution are?</h1>
         <p>Read on let me take you on a knowlegde journey on what it is!</p> 

           <div class="first_div">
               <h2>What is DOM?</h2>
                Imagine a website or a web page like a digital book. The DOM, or Document Object Model, is like a special way of looking at that book.  
                Picture the webpage as a tree:
                    <ol> - The whole webpage is the tree trunk.</ol>
                    <ol> - The branches are the big sections of the page, like the header, the main content, and the footer.</ol>
                    <ol> - The leaves are the small parts, like pictures, paragraphs, and buttons.</ol>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>What is DOM Manipulation?</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, think of DOM manipulation as changing the story in the book or rearranging the tree.
                    Here's an example:
    
                    Let's say you have a story where a character is wearing a red hat. With DOM manipulation, you can change that hat to be blue. Or, you can move a paragraph from one page to another.
    
                    So, DOM manipulation is like being a magician for web pages. You can make things appear, disappear, or change colors, just by using special codes.
    
                    In simple terms, it's like you have a magic wand to make the digital book look and behave exactly the way you want!
    
                    Remember, the DOM and DOM manipulation are just tools that web developers use to create and change what you see on websites. It's like they're the authors and illustrators of the digital world, making it fun and interesting for everyone!

            </div>

           <div>
                <h2> What is BOM?</h2>

                Okay, imagine you're using a computer to explore the internet, like you're on an adventure. The Browser Object Model (BOM) is like the special set of tools or gadgets your computer has to help you on this adventure.

                <h2>Think of it like this</h2>

                    <ol> 1-> Your Browser is Your Explorer Kit:
                        The browser is like a magic backpack that helps you explore the internet. It has buttons, an address bar, and other tools to make your adventure easy.
                    </ol>
                    <ol> 2-> BOM is Your Toolkit:
                        Inside your magic backpack, there's a toolkit called the Browser Object Model. This toolkit has special gadgets that let you do things like open new windows, check if you have internet, and lots more.
                    </ol>
           </div>
            
           <div>

            <h2> What is BOM Manipulation?</h2>
            Now, let's talk about BOM manipulation. It's like using those special gadgets in your toolkit to change the way you explore.

            Here's an example:

            Imagine you're exploring a website, and you find a cool button. With BOM manipulation, you can make that button bigger, change its color, or even make it do something completely different when you click on it.

            So, BOM manipulation is like having a remote control for your internet adventure. You can change how things look or make them do special tricks, all with the tools in your magic backpack.

            In simple terms, BOM and BOM manipulation are like giving you superpowers to make your internet exploration even more awesome and personalized! It's like being a superhero in the digital world, using your tools to make things just the way you like them.
